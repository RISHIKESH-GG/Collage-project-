# INFO
This is a banking application that allows users to create an account with a password, deposit and withdraw funds, check their balance, and calculate loan interest. The base code for this project is written in C++. To make the application more user-friendly, I integrated a graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt, a framework commonly used for building modern and intuitive UIs in C++.

The core functionality is maintained in the C++ code, which handles the banking operations such as account management and financial transactions. The Qt interface enhances the user experience by providing an easy-to-navigate and visually appealing environment.

The base code for the project is provided in the file named "base code(c++)."
